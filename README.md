# Visualization-Classification-Clusterization-Workshop-2020

Meet Machine Learning, there is no magic

Simplified code, minimum dependencies. Just install Anaconda, clone the repo, open `cats_and_dogs.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells one after another.

Hint: tSNE and PCA scatters are interactive. Use sliders (Widgets) to select and visualize pets!


Tested on Windows.
